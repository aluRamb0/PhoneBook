 # How to run this solution
 TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
 1.	install dotnet core sdk 3 & EF core tool [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
 2.	open terminal/cmd at the project root.
 3.	run ```bash cd PhoneBook.EfCore.Migrations```
 4.	then ```bash dotnet ef database update```
 
Thank you
